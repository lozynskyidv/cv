## Context
You are helping Dmytro Lozynskyi (24, Ukrainian in Ireland) tailor his CV for job applications to London tech companies (Google, Meta, Revolut, Wise, etc.) for Product Manager, Growth Manager, and Product Growth Manager roles.

This is an automated CV tailoring system. Dmytro will apply to 50 jobs in 10 days using this workflow.

## When User Pastes a Job Posting (LinkedIn URL or text)

**Immediately follow this process:**

### STEP 1: Acknowledge & Load Context
Say: "Analyzing job posting for [Company] [Role]..."

Then silently read these files to understand the system:
- @TAILORING_GUIDE.md (your detailed instruction manual)
- @cv_master.yaml (current CV data that you will edit)

### STEP 2: Analyze Job Posting
Before asking any questions, analyze:
- Extract 5-10 key requirements/skills
- Identify role type (0→1 PM vs Growth PM vs Technical PM)
- Spot pain points and priorities
- Note must-have vs nice-to-have skills
- Identify top keywords to integrate

### STEP 3: Ask 3-5 Strategic Questions
Ask focused questions about positioning and emphasis (NOT about keywords - you figure those out).

Examples:
- "This role emphasizes [X] - should I lead with WorthView founder story or PetSafe growth?"
- "Should I angle you as 'product builder' or 'growth-focused PM'?"
- "Any specific metrics to emphasize from WorthView or PetSafe?"

Keep it to 3-5 questions maximum.

### STEP 4: Tailor cv_master.yaml
After user answers, edit cv_master.yaml:

**Must follow:**
- Lead profile with founder story for PM roles
- Use "Accomplished X measured by Y by doing Z" format for bullets
- Add metrics to every bullet (use [VERIFY: X] placeholders if needed)
- Reorder skills to match job posting priorities
- Integrate keywords naturally
- Keep to 1 page worth of content

**Refer to TAILORING_GUIDE.md for detailed formatting rules**

### STEP 5: Show Changes & Ask for Confirmation
After editing cv_master.yaml, show user what changed:

1. **Run git diff** to show exactly what was modified:
   - Use Shell tool to run: `cd /Users/dmytrolozynskyi/Documents/cv && git diff cv_master.yaml`
   - Show the diff output so user sees changes

2. **Summarize key changes:**
```
✅ Tailored for [Job Title] at [Company]

Key changes:
- Profile: [what you emphasized]
- Experience: [key bullets changed]  
- Skills: [how you reordered]

⚠️ Placeholder metrics to verify:
- [List any [VERIFY: X] tags you added]
```

3. **Ask for confirmation:**
   "Does this look good? Reply 'yes' to generate PDF, or tell me what to adjust."

### STEP 6: Generate PDF Automatically
After user confirms (says "yes", "looks good", "generate", etc.):

1. **Run generate.py via Shell tool:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/dmytrolozynskyi/Documents/cv && python3 generate.py "[Job Title] at [Company]"
   ```

2. **Show success message:**
```
🎉 PDF generated successfully!

📄 Your tailored CV:
   output/Dmytro_Lozynskyi_[Job_Title]_[Company].pdf

✅ Ready to apply!

💡 Tip: Check output folder for your PDF
```

3. **Optional:** Ask if user wants to commit changes to git
