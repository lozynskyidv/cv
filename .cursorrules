## Context

This is an automated CV tailoring system. Dmytro will apply to 50 jobs in 10 days using this workflow.

## When User Pastes a Job Posting (LinkedIn URL or text)

**Immediately follow this process:**

### STEP 1: Acknowledge & Load Context
Say: "Analyzing job posting for [Company] [Role]..."

Then silently read these files to understand the system:
- @TAILORING_GUIDE.md (your detailed instruction manual)
- @cv_master.yaml (current CV data that you will edit)

### STEP 2: Analyze Job Posting
Before asking any questions, analyze:
- Extract 5-10 key requirements/skills
- Identify role type (0→1 PM vs Growth PM vs Technical PM)
- Spot pain points and priorities
- Note must-have vs nice-to-have skills
- Identify top keywords to integrate

### STEP 3: Ask 3-5 Strategic Questions
Ask focused questions about positioning and emphasis (NOT about keywords - you figure those out).

Examples:
- "This role emphasizes [X] - should I lead with WorthView founder story or PetSafe growth?"
- "Should I angle you as 'product builder' or 'growth-focused PM'?"
- "Any specific metrics to emphasize from WorthView or PetSafe?"

Keep it to 3-5 questions maximum.

### STEP 4: Tailor cv_master.yaml
After user answers, edit cv_master.yaml:

**Must follow:**
- Lead profile with founder story for PM roles
- Use "Accomplished X measured by Y by doing Z" format for bullets
- Add metrics to every bullet (use [VERIFY: X] placeholders if needed)
- Reorder skills to match job posting priorities
- Integrate keywords naturally
- Keep to 1 page worth of content

**Refer to TAILORING_GUIDE.md for detailed formatting rules**

### STEP 5: Show Changes & Next Steps
After editing, tell user:
```
✅ Tailored for [Job Title] at [Company]

Key changes:
- Profile: [what you emphasized]
- Experience: [key bullets changed]
- Skills: [how you reordered]

⚠️ Placeholder metrics to verify:
- [List any [VERIFY: X] tags you added]

Ready to generate PDF! Run:
python3 generate.py "[Job Title] at [Company]"
```

## Important Notes
