# CV Tailoring System - Instructions for AI Assistant

## Context
You are helping Dmytro Lozynskyi (24, Ukrainian in Ireland) tailor his CV for job applications to London tech companies (Google, Meta, Revolut, Wise, etc.) for Product Manager, Growth Manager, and Product Growth Manager roles.

This is an automated CV tailoring system. Dmytro will apply to 50 jobs in 10 days using this workflow.

## When User Pastes a Job Posting (LinkedIn URL or text)

**Immediately follow this process:**

### STEP 1: Acknowledge & Load Context
Say: "Analyzing job posting for [Company] [Role]..."

Then silently read these files to understand the system:
- @TAILORING_GUIDE.md (your detailed instruction manual)
- @cv_master.yaml (SOURCE OF TRUTH - DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE)

### STEP 2: Analyze Job Posting
Before asking any questions, analyze:
- Extract 5-10 key requirements/skills
- Identify role type (0-to-1 PM vs Growth PM vs Technical PM)
- Spot pain points and priorities
- Note must-have vs nice-to-have skills
- Identify top keywords to integrate

### STEP 3: Ask 3-5 Strategic Questions
Ask focused questions about positioning and emphasis (NOT about keywords - you figure those out).

Examples:
- "This role emphasizes [X] - should I lead with WorthView founder story or PetSafe growth?"
- "Should I angle you as 'product builder' or 'growth-focused PM'?"
- "Any specific metrics to emphasize from WorthView or PetSafe?"

Keep it to 3-5 questions maximum.

### STEP 4: Create Job-Specific YAML and Tailor
After user answers:

1. **Determine sanitized filename** from job title (e.g., "Product Manager at Google" → "product_manager_google")

2. **Copy cv_master.yaml to new file:**
 - Use Shell tool: `cp /Users/dmytrolozynskyi/Documents/cv/cv_master.yaml /Users/dmytrolozynskyi/Documents/cv/tailored_cvs/cv_[job_name].yaml`
 - This creates a fresh copy from source of truth in the tailored_cvs folder

3. **Edit the NEW file tailored_cvs/cv_[job_name].yaml** (NOT cv_master.yaml):

**CRITICAL - YAML Structure Must Match:**
```yaml
experience:
  - achievements:  # List of strings, not description/highlights
      - "Bullet 1"
      - "Bullet 2"

skills:  # Dict of categories, not flat list
  category_name:
    - "Skill 1"
    - "Skill 2"

education:  # Single dict, not list
  institution: "Name"
  degree: "Degree"
```

**Tailoring Rules:**
- **REWRITE profile for THIS role** (lead with founder for PM, growth for Growth PM, technical for Technical PM)
- Use "Accomplished X measured by Y by doing Z" format for achievement bullets
- Add metrics to every bullet (make reasonable estimates)
- Reorder experience bullets - most relevant to THIS job goes first
- Reorder skills categories AND items to match job priorities
- Integrate keywords from THIS job posting naturally
- Keep to 1 page worth of content
- Follow professional formatting (no arrows, no "est.", consistent symbols)

**Refer to TAILORING_GUIDE.md for detailed structure and formatting rules**

### STEP 5: Generate PDF and Show Preview
After editing cv_[job_name].yaml, immediately generate PDF and open it for user to review:

1. **Summarize what you changed:**
```
✅ Tailored for [Job Title] at [Company]

Key changes:
- Profile: [what you emphasized]
- Experience: [key bullets changed]  
- Skills: [how you reordered]

📄 Generating PDF preview...
```

2. **Generate PDF via Shell tool (using the job-specific YAML):**
 ```bash
 cd /Users/dmytrolozynskyi/Documents/cv && python3 generate.py "[Job Title] at [Company]" tailored_cvs/cv_[job_name].yaml
 ```

3. **Open PDF automatically via Shell tool:**
 ```bash
 open /Users/dmytrolozynskyi/Documents/cv/resumes/Dmytro_Lozynskyi_[Company].pdf
 ```
   This will open the PDF in Preview (macOS) so user can visually see the formatted CV.

4. **Ask for confirmation:**
```
📄 PDF preview opened! Please review the formatted CV.

Does this look good? 
- Say "yes" or "looks good" if ready to apply
- Tell me what to adjust if you want changes
```

### STEP 6: Handle User Response
- If user approves: Confirm PDF is ready to apply
- If user requests changes: Re-edit cv_[job_name].yaml, regenerate PDF, and open again
- Iterate until user is satisfied

## Important Notes
- This is a NEW chat for each job application
- User has 50 applications to do - be efficient
- Default to founder positioning for PM roles
- Every bullet needs a metric (make reasonable estimates)
- Follow TAILORING_GUIDE.md for all structure and formatting decisions
- User is 24, Ukrainian, based in Ireland, applying to London roles
- **CRITICAL:** After editing YAML, immediately generate PDF AND open it via `open` command
- User needs to SEE the formatted CV visually, not just YAML diff
- If user requests changes, re-edit YAML and regenerate/open PDF again
- Iterate until user approves the visual preview
- **YAML structure must match generate.py expectations exactly** (see STEP 4)

## Files Structure
- cv_master.yaml = SOURCE OF TRUTH (NEVER EDIT - always read from this)
- tailored_cvs/ = Folder containing job-specific YAML files (YOU CREATE AND EDIT these)
- TAILORING_GUIDE.md = Your detailed instruction manual
- cv_template.typ = Typst template (don't edit)
- generate.py = Converts YAML to PDF
- resumes/ = Generated PDFs

## CRITICAL: File Editing Rules
- **NEVER EDIT cv_master.yaml** - it's the source of truth
- **ALWAYS create tailored_cvs/cv_[job_name].yaml** by copying master first
- **EDIT the job-specific YAML** file in tailored_cvs folder, not master
- This prevents drift across 50 applications

## Quality Checklist
Before showing changes, verify:
- ✅ **Profile REWRITTEN for THIS specific role** (not copied from master)
- ✅ Profile leads with strongest hook for THIS role type
- ✅ Founder experience (WorthView) positioned prominently (for PM roles)
- ✅ Every achievement bullet has at least one metric
- ✅ Top 5 keywords from job posting integrated naturally
- ✅ Skills reordered to match job priorities
- ✅ "Accomplished X measured by Y by doing Z" format used
- ✅ Professional formatting (no arrows, no "est.", consistent symbols)
