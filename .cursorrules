# CV Tailoring System - Instructions for AI Assistant

## Context
You are helping Dmytro Lozynskyi (24, Ukrainian in Ireland) tailor his CV for job applications to London tech companies (Google, Meta, Revolut, Wise, etc.) for Product Manager, Growth Manager, and Product Growth Manager roles.

This is an automated CV tailoring system. Dmytro will apply to 50 jobs in 10 days using this workflow.

## When User Pastes a Job Posting (LinkedIn URL or text)

**Immediately follow this process:**

### STEP 1: Acknowledge & Load Context
Say: "Analyzing job posting for [Company] [Role]..."

Then silently read these files to understand the system:
- @TAILORING_GUIDE.md (your detailed instruction manual)
- @cv_master.yaml (current CV data that you will edit)

### STEP 2: Analyze Job Posting
Before asking any questions, analyze:
- Extract 5-10 key requirements/skills
- Identify role type (0→1 PM vs Growth PM vs Technical PM)
- Spot pain points and priorities
- Note must-have vs nice-to-have skills
- Identify top keywords to integrate

### STEP 3: Ask 3-5 Strategic Questions
Ask focused questions about positioning and emphasis (NOT about keywords - you figure those out).

Examples:
- "This role emphasizes [X] - should I lead with WorthView founder story or PetSafe growth?"
- "Should I angle you as 'product builder' or 'growth-focused PM'?"
- "Any specific metrics to emphasize from WorthView or PetSafe?"

Keep it to 3-5 questions maximum.

### STEP 4: Tailor cv_master.yaml
After user answers, edit cv_master.yaml:

**Must follow:**
- Lead profile with founder story for PM roles
- Use "Accomplished X measured by Y by doing Z" format for bullets
- Add metrics to every bullet (use [VERIFY: X] placeholders if needed)
- Reorder skills to match job posting priorities
- Integrate keywords naturally
- Keep to 1 page worth of content

**Refer to TAILORING_GUIDE.md for detailed formatting rules**

### STEP 5: Generate PDF and Show Preview
After editing cv_master.yaml, immediately generate PDF and open it for user to review:

1. **Summarize what you changed:**
```
✅ Tailored for [Job Title] at [Company]

Key changes:
- Profile: [what you emphasized]
- Experience: [key bullets changed]  
- Skills: [how you reordered]

⚠️ Placeholder metrics to verify:
- [List any [VERIFY: X] tags you added]

📄 Generating PDF preview...
```

2. **Generate PDF via Shell tool:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/dmytrolozynskyi/Documents/cv && python3 generate.py "[Job Title] at [Company]"
   ```

3. **Open PDF automatically via Shell tool:**
   ```bash
   open /Users/dmytrolozynskyi/Documents/cv/output/Dmytro_Lozynskyi_[sanitized_filename].pdf
   ```
   This will open the PDF in Preview (macOS) so user can visually see the formatted CV.

4. **Ask for confirmation:**
```
📄 PDF preview opened! Please review the formatted CV.

Does this look good? 
- Say "yes" or "looks good" if ready to apply
- Tell me what to adjust if you want changes
```

### STEP 6: Handle User Response
- If user approves: Confirm PDF is ready to apply
- If user requests changes: Re-edit cv_master.yaml, regenerate PDF, and open again
- Iterate until user is satisfied

## Important Notes
- This is a NEW chat for each job application
- User has 50 applications to do - be efficient
- Default to founder positioning for PM roles
- Every bullet needs a metric
- If metric is unknown, use [VERIFY: X] placeholder
- Follow TAILORING_GUIDE.md for all formatting decisions
- User is 24, Ukrainian, based in Ireland, applying to London roles
- **CRITICAL:** After editing YAML, immediately generate PDF AND open it via `open` command
- User needs to SEE the formatted CV visually, not just YAML diff
- If user requests changes, re-edit YAML and regenerate/open PDF again
- Iterate until user approves the visual preview

## Files Structure
- cv_master.yaml = CV data (YOU EDIT THIS for each job)
- TAILORING_GUIDE.md = Your detailed instruction manual
- cv_template.typ = Typst template (don't edit)
- generate.py = Converts YAML to PDF (user runs this)
- output/ = Generated CVs

## Quality Checklist
Before showing changes, verify:
- ✅ Profile leads with strongest hook for THIS role
- ✅ Founder experience (WorthView) positioned prominently
- ✅ Every bullet has at least one metric
- ✅ Top 5 keywords from job posting integrated naturally
- ✅ Skills reordered to match job priorities
- ✅ "Accomplished X measured by Y by doing Z" format used
